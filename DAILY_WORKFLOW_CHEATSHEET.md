# 🚀 Daily Development Workflow - Cheat Sheet

## Your New Confident Development Flow

### ✅ **Before You Start Coding** (Optional)
```bash
# Quick health check (30 seconds)
bun run lint:analyze
```
*See your progress and feel good about improvements!*

### 🔥 **During Development** (Business as Usual)
```bash
# Start development - warnings won't block you!
bun run dev

# Build when ready - warnings won't stop builds!
bun run build

# Type check when needed
bun run type-check
```
*Code with confidence - focus on features, not linting noise!*

### 🧹 **When Editing Files** (2-3 minutes max)
If you're already editing a file and want to clean up:

```bash
# See what warnings exist in files you're touching
bun run lint:fix-unused | grep "filename-you-are-editing"
```

**Quick fixes while you're there:**
- Add `_` prefix to unused variables: `error` → `_error`
- Remove unused imports you don't need
- Change `let` to `const` if variable doesn't change

### 📊 **Weekly Progress Check** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Friday afternoon ritual
bun run lint:analyze

# Compare with last week - celebrate improvements! 🎉
```

## 🎯 **Priority Guide**

### Fix These First (High Impact)
1. **Next.js Image Optimizations** (2 warnings)
   - File: `CompareImage.tsx`
   - Replace `<img>` with `<Image>` from `next/image`

### Fix These When Convenient (Medium Impact)
2. **Code Quality Issues** (3 warnings)
   - `prefer-const` warnings
   - Unsafe optional chaining

### Fix These During Cleanup (Low Impact)
3. **Unused Variables** (116 warnings)
   - Add `_` prefix for intentionally unused
   - Remove truly unnecessary imports

## 🛠️ **Quick Commands Reference**

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `bun run lint` | Standard linting | Before commits |
| `bun run lint:analyze` | Detailed breakdown | Weekly progress |
| `bun run lint:fix-unused` | Fix suggestions | When editing files |
| `bun run type-check` | TypeScript validation | After changes |
| `bun run dev` | Start development | Always works! |
| `bun run build` | Build project | Always works! |

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### If Something Seems Broken
1. **Check if it's actually broken** - warnings ≠ errors
2. **Run basic commands**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev    # Should always work
   bun run build  # Should always work
   ```
3. **If truly stuck** - ask for help, don't disable ESLint!

### If You Need to Temporarily Ignore a Warning
```typescript
// Only use in emergencies!
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
const temporaryVariable = something;
```

## 🎉 **Success Metrics**

### Daily Success
- ✅ Development flows smoothly
- ✅ Builds complete without blocking
- ✅ You're focused on features, not linting

### Weekly Success  
- ✅ Warning count trending down
- ✅ No new warnings in new code
- ✅ Team comfortable with workflow

### Monthly Success
- ✅ Significant warning reduction
- ✅ Improved code quality habits
- ✅ Ready for Next.js 15 upgrade

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Don't batch fix warnings** - integrate with normal development
2. **Use underscore prefix liberally** - `_error`, `_unused`, `_temp`
3. **Focus on files you're already editing** - natural cleanup opportunities
4. **Celebrate small wins** - every warning fixed is progress!
5. **Remember the goal** - confident development, not perfect linting
